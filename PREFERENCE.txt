I think Flask is much easier to work with than Django. Flask is much more lightweight and can be used easily when working with small projects. 
Django is full fledged framework and it divides project into small modules called applications so it will be easier to manage large application with it.
So It depends on the scale project which one to use. Both are great in my opinion.
